This Project aims at creating a Python based Cyberoam client. 

To use this script:

* install python 2.7
* save this script file on your computer.
* the first time, execute:
        python cyberthon.py
  on your terminal / command prompt.
* on subsequent logins, execute:
        python cyberthon.py -f PATH
  where PATH is the file path to the config file eg: /home/cooluser/cyberoam.config
  or C:\Users\user\cyberoam.config
* you will remain logged in as long as the terminal is open.
* Enjoy :)
